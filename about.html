            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>My name is Stephanie White and I am from a small farming town located in South Florida called Belle Glade. My hometown is mostly known for the football athletes it produces but it is also known for being a key 'player' in the sugar industry.</p><!-- closed paragraph-->
            <h2>Education</h2>
         <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Telecommunications and minoring in African American Studies. After I graduate in the fall, I am going to take a year off before starting graduate school and volunteer with a non-profit organization, preferably American Red Cross. </p>
