            <h2>Life:</h2>
            <p>My name is Stephanie White and I am from a small farming town located in South Florida called Belle Glade. My hometown is mostly known for the football athletes it produces but it is also known for being a key 'player' in the sugar industry.</p><!-- closed paragraph-->
            <h2>Education:</h2>
         <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Telecommunications and minoring in African American Studies.</p>
            <h2>Why I chose telecommunications:</h2>
            <p>I love people! Perfecting how to properly communicate with others is highly valuable in the journalism and communications world. It is extremely hard to have a successful career without networking and establishing great business relationships.</p>
             <h2>After graduation:</h2>
             <p>I will be graduating this fall semester and my plan is to apply for the 2015 Teach for America (TFA) application on August 1st. I have not decided on what subject I would like to teach or where I would prefer to be located. If my application is denied by TFA then I will take a year off before starting graduate school in Business Administration to volunteer with a non-profit organization, preferably American Red Cross.</p>
